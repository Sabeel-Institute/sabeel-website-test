## Maintainer notes

- Program entries use a discriminated union on `status`
  (`src/content.config.ts`); open and ongoing programs fail the build if a
  listing field is missing. Folder names are validated in `generateId`, and
  `womens-learning` / `youth-children` are reserved for the area pages.
- `assertBespokePages` (`src/lib/content.ts`) runs while program pages are
  generated and fails the build when a `page:` value has no matching file in
  `src/pages/`.
- `Photo.astro` resolves named slots from `src/assets/photos/` with
  `import.meta.glob`; a missing file renders the geometric fallback, so slots
  never break the build.
- The giving form cannot pass an amount to the GiveWP form on oursabeel.com
  (no URL parameter support), so it opens the form and shows the donor their
  selection to re-enter. Point `site.giving` at a processor that accepts
  amounts to remove that step.
- `dateApprox: true` marks programs whose year is inferred rather than
  printed on the flyer; pages show only the year for them.
- `firebase.json` redirects other addresses for these pages (`/courses/`,
  `/our-team/`, `/seminary/`, `/donate/`, `/our-mission/`, `/my-courses/`,
  and more) so existing links keep working.
- Deploys, the Google identity pool, and every setting to change when the
  project, account, repository, branch, or domain moves are documented in
  `docs/deployment.md`. `preview.yml` runs from `main` via `workflow_run` and
  must never execute pull-request code.
